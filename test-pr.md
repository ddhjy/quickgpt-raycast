# Test PR for Claude Code Action

This is a test file created to demonstrate the Claude Code workflow integration with Zhipu GLM-4.5.

## Purpose

To test the `/claude` command functionality in PR comments and verify the Action workflow execution.

## Expected Behavior

When the `/claude` command is used in PR comments, it should trigger the Claude Code workflow which will proxy requests to Zhipu GLM-4.5 API.
