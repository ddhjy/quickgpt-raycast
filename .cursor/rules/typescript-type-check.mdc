# TypeScript Type Checking Rule

Before finalizing TypeScript code changes or generating new TypeScript code, please ensure its type correctness by running the following command in the terminal:

`npx tsc --noEmit` and `npx eslint ./src/`

This command will check the entire project for TypeScript errors without generating any output files. This helps catch potential issues early.
