# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature ensures that Copy and Paste operations specified by users in hjson configuration files have the highest priority in the system, overriding all other settings and configurations. This provides users with ultimate control over copy/paste behavior through their hjson configurations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want my hjson-specified Copy and Paste operations to take precedence over all other settings, so that I have complete control over these operations regardless of other configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user specifies Copy operation in hjson THEN the system SHALL use that Copy operation with highest priority
2. WHEN a user specifies Paste operation in hjson THEN the system SHALL use that Paste operation with highest priority
3. WHEN hjson Copy/Paste operations conflict with other settings THEN the system SHALL prioritize hjson specifications
4. WHEN hjson Copy/Paste operations are defined THEN the system SHALL ignore all other Copy/Paste configurations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to clearly identify and load hjson Copy/Paste configurations, so that my specified operations are properly recognized and applied.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system starts THEN it SHALL scan for hjson files containing Copy/Paste operations
2. WHEN hjson files are modified THEN the system SHALL reload Copy/Paste operation configurations
3. WHEN multiple hjson files contain Copy/Paste operations THEN the system SHALL apply a consistent priority resolution
4. IF hjson Copy/Paste operations are malformed THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the priority system to be transparent and predictable, so that I understand which Copy/Paste operations will be executed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Copy/Paste operations are loaded THEN the system SHALL log which operations have highest priority
2. WHEN priority conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL document the resolution logic
3. WHEN hjson operations override other settings THEN the system SHALL indicate which settings were overridden
4. IF no hjson Copy/Paste operations are found THEN the system SHALL fall back to default behavior

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the priority system to be maintainable and extensible, so that future changes don't break the hjson priority guarantee.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new configuration sources are added THEN hjson Copy/Paste operations SHALL maintain highest priority
2. WHEN the priority system is modified THEN hjson supremacy SHALL be preserved
3. WHEN system updates occur THEN hjson Copy/Paste priority SHALL remain unchanged
4. IF priority logic changes THEN hjson operations SHALL continue to override all other sources
